# CLIXToken addon module for EvolutionScript

- Upload all the files in the UPLOAD directory to your server

- Make sure to keep the folder structure intact

- After uploading visit your admin panel's Utilities -> Addon Modules

- Click on 'Clixtoken'

- Click on 'Install' when asked

- After installation check out the 'Readme' section of the addon for additional information

- The user interface is located in yourwebsite.com/clixtoken.php

## Note:

If your template folder's name is different from the default 'ModernBlue', simply upload the containing clixtoken.tpl file into your own template folder.

If you would like to turn your website into a CLIXToken only site, you can edit the **withdraw.tpl** file in your template directory. Back it up first, then replace its contents with ```<script>location.href="https://yourwebsite.com/clixtoken.php"</script>``` to have your website's withdraw page redirect your users straight to the new CLIXToken converter.
